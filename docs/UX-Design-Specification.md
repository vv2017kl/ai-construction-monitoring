# Construction AI Monitoring System - UX Design Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Industry Perspective:** Construction Industry Veteran  

---

## Executive Summary

As a construction industry veteran with 25+ years of experience, I've designed this UX specification to address real-world construction site management challenges. The system must handle the chaos of active construction sites, provide actionable insights for safety managers, and be intuitive enough for site coordinators who may not be tech-savvy.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Safety First**: Critical alerts must be impossible to miss
- **Context Awareness**: Every screen must show site context and current conditions
- **Mobile-First**: Field personnel work with tablets, not desktops
- **Role-Based**: Each user sees only what they need for their job
- **Evidence-Based**: Every decision must be backed by visual evidence
