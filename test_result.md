# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# Testing Data - Main Agent and testing sub agent both should log testing data below this section
#====================================================================================================

user_problem_statement: |
  Please analyze the data sources for the Dashboard by testing each API endpoint that feeds the Dashboard. Focus on:

  1. **Dashboard Stats API**: Test `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - what actual data is this returning?

  2. **ZoneMinder APIs**: 
     - Test `GET /api/zoneminder/status` - system status data
     - Test `GET /api/zoneminder/cameras` - camera data (should show 24 cameras from mock connector)
     - Test `GET /api/zoneminder/events` - recent events data

  3. **Backend Database APIs**:
     - Test `GET /api/sites` - sites data from database
     - Test `GET /api/users` - user data
     - Test `GET /api/` - basic health check

  4. **Data Analysis**:
     - For each API, show exactly what data is returned
     - Identify which data is from mock generators vs database vs hardcoded
     - Trace where the Dashboard metrics are coming from:
       * "23/24" camera status
       * "8.7/10" safety score  
       * "94% PPE compliance"
       * Live activity events (PPE violations, personnel count, etc.)
       * Weather data (87°F, 9 mph wind)

  I need to understand the complete data flow to explain to the user where each piece of Dashboard data originates (API mock data, database records, or hardcoded fallbacks).

(found 29 events with proper filters applied) (3) Various timezone-aware datetime formats (ISO with Z, timezone offset, simple ISO) - ✅ All working (4) Combined datetime and other filters - ✅ Working (minor validation issue with detection_type not related to datetime fix) (5) Dashboard recent events API call - ✅ DASHBOARD FIX CONFIRMED! (Dashboard can successfully load 29 recent events) (6) Error handling for invalid datetime formats - ✅ Proper validation. The critical 500 error 'can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes' is completely resolved. The fix properly converts timezone-aware datetimes (with tzinfo) to timezone-naive using .replace(tzinfo=None) before passing to the ZoneMinder connector.

Database tables (navigation_routes, route_waypoints, navigation_sessions, street_view_cameras) verified and accessible with proper foreign key constraints. The Navigation & Street View functionality is fully operational and ready for GPS-guided construction site navigation, route management, waypoint tracking, session monitoring, and street view camera integration."

    message: "🎭 ZONEMINDER CONNECTOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY! Achieved 96.2% success rate (51/53 tests passed) across 5 major testing categories. Key achievements: (1) Connector Factory & Configuration - Factory pattern working perfectly with seamless mode switching between mock/real, configuration loading from environment variables ✅ (2) Mock Connector Functionality - Complete CRUD operations for cameras, streams, events, zones ✅, realistic stream management with RTSP simulation ✅, comprehensive detection event handling with filtering/acknowledgment/resolution ✅, monitoring zones with construction-specific types ✅, analytics with site-wide insights ✅, system health monitoring ✅ (3) Mock Data Generators - ConstructionDataGenerator creating realistic construction sites ✅, intelligent camera placement based on site types ✅, construction-specific detection events (PPE violations, safety hazards, equipment operation, progress milestones) ✅, comprehensive analytics with safety/productivity/equipment/personnel metrics ✅ (4) RTSP Stream Simulator - Dynamic scenario generation based on time/camera type/location ✅, realistic construction activities (concrete pour, steel erection, safety inspections) ✅, viewer activity simulation ✅ (5) Integration Testing - End-to-end workflow from configuration to data generation to streaming ✅, mock statistics tracking ✅. Generated rich mock data: 24 cameras across 3 construction sites, 810 detection events over 30 days, 48 monitoring zones. Fixed minor issues with configuration presets and RTSP stream info handling. ZoneMinder connector is production-ready for frontend development with seamless switching between mock and real modes. This enables parallel frontend development with rich construction industry data while real ZoneMinder integration is prepared."
