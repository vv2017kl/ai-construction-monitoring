The previous AI engineer initiated the transformation of the AI-CONSTRUCTION MVP, focusing initially on stabilizing the GeoSpatial View. The core of their work, and subsequently continued by the current AI engineer, has been a systematic, screen-by-screen analysis of the entire frontend to build a robust backend roadmap. This involved documenting functional, database, ZoneMinder, and Roboflow integration requirements for each of the 27 identified application screens. A critical architectural decision was the establishment and continuous update of  as the single source of truth for database definitions. The trajectory showcases the completion of this exhaustive screen analysis for all 27 screens, with corresponding  files created. Additionally, the engineer began implementing role-based UI complexity management for newly added/completed frontend screens and extensively analyzed the role-based access control (RBAC) system. The current status is that all frontend screen analyses are complete, but core backend services, database creation, and full ZoneMinder integration are pending.

The overarching goal is to transform the AI-CONSTRUCTION MVP into a comprehensive construction management system. This involves fully implementing all 27 identified application screens (17 User, 9 Admin, 1 dynamic), including their functional, database, VMS (ZoneMinder), AI (Roboflow), and backend API specifications. A central requirement is the migration from MongoDB to AWS MySQL, necessitating a detailed  as the definitive source. Key accomplishments before this summary include the initial implementation of 8 core screens and an enhanced GeoSpatial View. The ongoing work has centered on completing the comprehensive analysis of all 27 screens and documenting their requirements, as well as initiating role-based UI simplification. Future tasks involve addressing specific bug fixes (Personnel Management), completing core functionality (My Profile), and, crucially, implementing the full backend FastAPI services, creating the AWS MySQL database structure, and integrating ZoneMinder.

**Key Files and Modifications:**
-   ****: The main React application entry point. It contains the routing logic for all frontend screens. It was recently updated to include routes for the newly analyzed and completed , , and  screens.
-   ****: This directory contains all user-facing screens. All 17 user screens are now implemented, with recent additions/completions including  (for comparing street views),  (a newly discovered screen), and the completion of  along with the creation of  and . These new files also incorporate initial role-based UI complexity logic.
-   ****: This directory contains all admin-facing screens. All 9 admin screens (including , , , , , , ) have been fully analyzed and documented.
-   ****: This is the single source of truth for the database schema. It has been continuously updated throughout the screen analysis process, growing from an initial 27 tables to approximately 110 tables, reflecting the comprehensive data requirements for all 27 screens. It's crucial for the planned AWS MySQL migration.
-   ****: A dedicated markdown file (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , ) was created for each of the 27 application screens. These documents detail functional requirements, database needs, ZoneMinder, AI, and backend API specifications, forming the backbone for future backend development.
-   ****: This document tracks the progress of screen analysis and prioritizes the next screens to be analyzed. It was continuously updated to reflect 100% completion of screen analysis.
-   ****: A newly created document combining detailed analysis of UI complexity for normal users and a comprehensive breakdown of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, including roles, camera access matrix, database tables, and configuration workflows.
-   ****: A recently created document that saves the current implementation plan and status, acting as a crucial checkpoint for future development.

<pending_tasks>
-   Personnel Management Screen: Fix known runtime bug.
-   AWS MySQL Setup: User needs to provide connection details for migration.
-   ZoneMinder Integration: Discuss ZM version, deployment, and implement the client module.
-   Backend FastAPI Services: Implement core backend APIs (~600+ endpoints) for all 27 screens.
-   Database Creation: Create the actual AWS MySQL database structure with ~110 tables.
-   Retroactive Role-Based UI: Apply role-based UI complexity management to all *existing* screens.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the systematic, comprehensive screen-by-screen analysis for all 27 application screens. This involved reading each frontend component file (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , , ), and then creating detailed  documents for each, outlining functional, database, VMS, AI, and backend API requirements. Concurrently, the  was continuously updated, now comprising approximately 110 tables, serving as a comprehensive blueprint for the AWS MySQL migration.

Following the screen analysis, the AI engineer also addressed the user's request to analyze frontend UI complexity for normal users and detailed the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system, documenting this in . This included identifying key RBAC database tables (, , , , ) and the relevant frontend configuration screens (, , ).

The most recent work involved implementing the *missing* frontend screens (, ) and completing  functionality, along with integrating initial role-based UI complexity features (progressive disclosure, simplified language) into these specific files. The  routing was updated to include these new screens.

The current state is that the *entire functional analysis of the application's frontend is complete, and the database schema is fully designed*. However, the backend FastAPI services, the actual database creation in AWS MySQL, and the ZoneMinder integration are not yet implemented. The conversation concluded with the AI engineer clarifying what was completed for Step 1 and waiting for the user's direction on applying role-based UI to *existing* screens and the sequence for backend/ZoneMinder implementation.

<optional_next_step>
Address the user's clarification regarding applying role-based UI complexity to other *existing* frontend screens and confirm the preferred sequence for backend API development and ZoneMinder integration.
