The previous AI engineer successfully guided the design phase of a comprehensive construction management system. Initially, the project aimed for a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack with cloud AI. However, significant requirements shifts occurred: a pivot from MongoDB to **MySQL**, a preference for **local AI model hosting** (YOLOv8/v9 with TensorRT) instead of cloud Roboflow, and the introduction of advanced features like Live Security Guard, Interactive Zones with IoT control, and a full VMS/NVR System.

The engineer iteratively analyzed these requirements, refining the database design. Facing a large DDL, a crucial consolidation step reduced 60 tables to 35, followed by a major architectural decision to separate the system into two independent microservices: a **VMS/NVR Core** and a **Construction AI Management** system, each with its own MySQL database. The DDL for this split architecture has been meticulously detailed and saved as a document and fragmented SQL files. The current state involves addressing a bug where the generated schema files were incomplete.

The goal is a 360/Fisheye IP camera-driven building construction management system. Key features include:
1.  **Global Map View**: Google Map-like interface (later specified as Cesium) with site PINs. Clicking PINs leads to live RTSP streams.
2.  **Live Camera Feeds**: Display RTSP streams.
3.  **Historical Comparison**: Users can select dates/timezones to compare feeds across cameras.
4.  **AI Analysis**: AI provides summaries and observations at a camera level (e.g., PPE compliance). Initial request for Roboflow, later refined to local YOLOv8/v9 with TensorRT models.
5.  **Mobile Field Assessor**: Tablet-based system with site map overlays, path drawing for moving cameras, and historical video comparison.
6.  **Alerts & Compliance**: Alerts for objections/compliances from both fixed and moving cameras, displayed on a dashboard. Alerts can be acted upon or kept open.
7.  **Core Management Features**: Notifications, user management (SYSADMIN, COMPANY EXEC, Group Site Manager, Site Manager, Site Coordinator roles with escalation paths), department management, site management, pin management, location management.
8.  **Views**: Live view (objects, live alerts), Comparison view (date/time), Historical view (audit, calendar search).
9.  **Portals**: Administration, Monitoring.
10. **Video Stream Reception**: System to receive live video streams (evolved into an internal, swappable VMS/NVR).
11. **Zone Management**: Ability to draw zones on video streams, add event data from IoT/SCADA, and later extended to include interactive buttons to invoke third-party APIs (e.g., IoT switch off). Zones can be pre-configured shapes.
12. **Live Security Guard**: Automated camera roll setup, defining patrol paths on a site map to simulate a security guard.
13. **Dynamic Camera Configuration**: Ability to create forms and call camera APIs to administer various camera settings, accommodating different brands/models.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend).
-   **Database**: MySQL (changed from MongoDB).
-   **Mapping**: CesiumJS (recommended over Google Maps for 3D/GIS).
-   **AI**: YOLOv8/v9, TensorRT (for local, optimized inference), Ultralytics.
-   **Architecture**: Microservices, Independent VMS/NVR Core, Application-level cross-database integrity.
-   **Data Storage**: JSON columns in MySQL, UUIDs for primary keys.
-   **Streaming**: RTSP stream handling, video chunking.
-   **Deployment**: Docker/Kubernetes container environment.

<code_architecture>
The application is designed as a full-stack React frontend with a FastAPI backend, structured as two independent microservices for modularity and flexibility.

**High-Level Architecture:**
The system is divided into two main, independent components, each with its own MySQL database:
1.  **VMS/NVR Core System**: Handles all video management, recording, camera configuration, and related metrics.
2.  **Construction AI Management System**: Contains all business logic, AI analysis results, user management, site data, alerts, and reporting.

Communication between these systems will be via REST APIs, WebSocket streams, and potentially a Message Queue. A VMS abstraction layer is planned to allow switching between the internal VMS and external VMS providers.

**Detailed Directory Structure (as per generated files):**



**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   : This comprehensive markdown document details the entire database design, including the architectural split, DDL for all 35 tables (12 VMS, 23 Construction), relationships, indexing strategies, JSON schema examples, and notes on deployment, scaling, and security. It serves as the single source of truth for the database schema.
-   : This script is crucial for the initial setup, defining the  and  databases, which are fundamental to the microservices architecture.
-   : This file contains the complete DDL for the VMS database tables, covering camera manufacturers, models, configurations, API endpoints, video storage, encoders, recording policies, and VMS-specific performance/system/audit/access logs. It defines the core video handling capabilities.
-    (or its complete version): This file will contain the complete DDL for the Construction Management database, encompassing organizational structure, user management, geographic data, AI detection results, alert systems, field assessment, live security guard system, interactive zones, reporting, and external system integrations. It defines the business logic and core application data.

Changes to these files involve meticulous SQL DDL definitions, including UUID primary keys, JSON column types for flexible configurations, and detailed comments explaining each field's purpose. Partitioning strategies for large time-series tables (e.g., , ) are also defined within the DDL or separate index scripts.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Complete **: The previous AI engineer acknowledged that the  file (and implicitly  which was later addressed) was incomplete and initiated a fix. While  was created, the full  update remains.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively working on correcting an issue related to the completeness of the generated DDL schema files. After providing a comprehensive DDL design document and then attempting to save fragmented SQL schema files, the user explicitly questioned whether all tables are part of schema files. This triggered an internal bug report flag for the AI engineer.

Upon review, the engineer confirmed the schema files were indeed incomplete. As a direct response to this, the engineer proceeded to fix the issue. The last action observed was the successful writing of the corrected VMS schema file: .

This indicates that the engineer has successfully addressed the incompleteness for the VMS part of the database. The next logical step, implied but not explicitly completed in the provided trajectory, would be to ensure the  file also contains the complete DDL for all 23 Construction Management tables as per the consolidated design document. The system is currently in a state where the database design is finalized and documented, but the executable SQL schema files for the application-level database require finalization to match the full design.
