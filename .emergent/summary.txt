The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the project from initial design to high-fidelity wireframe implementation, completing several critical phases. Initially, the focus was on refining the database schema, successfully consolidating and detailing 35 tables across two microservice databases (VMS and Construction Management). This included fixing incomplete DDL files and providing a comprehensive design document. Subsequently, the engineer moved to UX/UI design, creating detailed specifications for 22 screens across four portals, incorporating complex features like time-lapse and advanced street view capabilities, and defining a robust navigation system. The current effort is centered on implementing these designs as high-fidelity React wireframes. The login page and dashboard are successfully rendered with a Microsoft Office blue theme and mock data. However, the modularization of the frontend codebase, as requested by the user, has introduced persistent import and routing issues, leading to blank pages for newly added screens. The engineer is actively addressing these frontend integration challenges while progressively adding more screen components.

The overarching goal is a 360/Fisheye IP camera-driven construction management system. Key requirements include:
1.  **Map Integration**: Global map (Cesium) with site PINs linking to live RTSP streams.
2.  **Video Feeds**: Live RTSP, Historical Comparison (date/time/timezone), and a newly added Time Lapse view.
3.  **AI Analysis**: Local YOLOv8/v9 with TensorRT for PPE compliance, personnel/equipment tracking, and general observations.
4.  **Mobile Field Assessor**: Tablet-based system with site map overlays, GPS-guided path drawing, real-time Street View navigation, and historical street view playback.
5.  **Alerts & Compliance**: Dashboard for fixed/moving camera alerts with escalation paths.
6.  **Core Management**: User (multi-role), department, site, pin, location management, and notifications.
7.  **Zone Management**: Drawing interactive zones on video, IoT/SCADA integration, and invoking third-party APIs.
8.  **Live Security Guard**: Automated camera patrol setup and path definition.
9.  **Dynamic Camera Config**: API-driven administration for various camera brands/models.
The application is structured with a React frontend and FastAPI backend, split into two independent microservices: VMS/NVR Core and Construction AI Management, each with its own MySQL database. UX design specifies 22 screens across Solution User, Solution Admin, VMS User, and VMS Admin portals, with a Microsoft Office blue theme and adaptable color options.

**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   : Central document for the complete 35-table database design, detailing the microservices split, DDL, relationships, and indexing strategies. It's the definitive source for database architecture.
-   : Contains the finalized DDL for the 12 VMS database tables, covering video management specifics. This was recently completed.
-   : Contains the finalized DDL for the 23 Construction Management database tables, encompassing business logic, AI results, and user management. This was recently completed and consolidated from multiple parts.
-   : Details the 22 screens across the 4 portals, their purpose, functionality, and database integration. It was recently updated to include missing features like Time Lapse and advanced Street View.
-   : Defines the entire navigation structure, left panel menus for each portal, responsive design, and accessibility features.
-   : The main React application entry point, now responsible for defining routes for the , , and other portal-specific screens using the new modular structure. It also wraps the application with .
-   : Defines the application's color palette, including the Microsoft Office blue theme. This is foundational for the UI's aesthetic.
-   : Manages the application's theme, allowing for dynamic theme changes (though not yet implemented for user selection). Crucial for consistent styling.
-   : Provides brilliant, hardcoded fake data for populating wireframe components, ensuring a realistic appearance without backend connectivity.
-    (now moved to ): The initial high-fidelity wireframe login page, supporting portal selection and hardcoded login action.
-   : The first primary high-fidelity wireframe screen, showcasing live metrics, site details, activity feeds, and core navigation elements.

The frontend is currently undergoing a modular restructuring, with core layout components in  and individual portal screens (e.g., , ) now residing in . This refactoring aims to support scalable development for the eventual full application.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Resolve Frontend Import/Path Issues**: The modular restructuring of the React frontend has led to persistent import errors (specifically with ). This needs to be resolved for new screens to render correctly.
-   **Continue High-Fidelity Wireframe Implementation**: Build out the remaining 22 screens as per the  and , with hardcoded data and functional navigation. The next screens in line after  are  and others.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was deeply engaged in the high-fidelity wireframe development phase for the frontend. After successfully finalizing the database design documents and UX/Navigation specifications, the task shifted to building out the user interface as working prototypes without backend integration.

The engineer had successfully implemented:
1.  **Theme System**: A  and  were created to implement the Microsoft Office blue theme, making the UI visually appealing.
2.  **Mock Data**:  was populated with realistic, hardcoded data to simulate a live application environment.
3.  **Login Page**: A  was created (and later moved to ) with a professional UI, portal selection, and a working (hardcoded) login action.
4.  **Core Layout**: Shared layout components like , , and  were established to provide a consistent application shell.
5.  **Dashboard Screen**:  (now in ) was implemented as a stunning high-fidelity wireframe, displaying mock metrics, live activity feeds, and a functional sidebar navigation.

The most recent work involved a significant refactoring of the frontend codebase into a modular structure (e.g., moving pages into ). This was done at the user's request to ensure the wireframes could be used for future real development. However, this refactoring introduced recurring import errors, specifically with , causing newly created pages to render blank.

Despite these ongoing import issues, the engineer continued to build out more screens for the Solution User Portal, including:
-   
-    (initially created as a test for imports)
-   
-   

At the point of interruption, the engineer had just finished creating  and was about to start working on the  screen, all while still battling the underlying import resolution problem affecting the new modular pages. The  file is consistently being updated to include new routes for these pages.
