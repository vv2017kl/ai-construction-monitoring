The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the construction management application from initial wireframe concepts to a fully functional high-fidelity frontend. The primary focus was on resolving critical import and routing issues that arose from a modular refactoring of the React codebase, particularly affecting  and  paths within layout components. Once these foundational issues were fixed, the engineer systematically implemented 18 screens for the Solution User Portal, meticulously following UX specifications and integrating mock data. Key achievements include creating visually stunning dashboards, complex analytics views, and critical management interfaces (personnel, reports, field assessment). Subsequent efforts concentrated on refining the user experience by optimizing the sidebar (removing redundant elements, ensuring scrollability), and fixing several reported bugs related to data imports and theme property access. The trajectory concludes with the engineer planning and initiating the development of the Solution Admin Portal, demonstrating a clear progression and completion of the initial frontend wireframe phase.

The goal is a 360/Fisheye IP camera-driven construction management system. Key features include global map integration (Cesium) with live RTSP streams, historical video feeds (Time Lapse, Comparison), local AI analysis (YOLOv8/v9, TensorRT) for PPE and tracking, a mobile Field Assessor with Street View navigation, alerts, core management (user, site, zone), automated camera patrols, and dynamic camera configuration. The application uses a React frontend and FastAPI backend, split into VMS/NVR Core and Construction AI Management microservices, each with its own MySQL database. UX design specifies 22 screens across four portals (Solution User, Solution Admin, VMS User, VMS Admin) with a Microsoft Office blue theme. So far, the Solution User Portal, comprising 18 screens, has been fully implemented as high-fidelity wireframes with mock data and a consistent theme.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had successfully completed the entire Solution User Portal, bringing the total number of fully functional, high-fidelity wireframe screens to 18. This involved resolving all initial frontend import and routing issues, making the sidebar fully scrollable and optimized for navigation, and fixing specific bugs related to mock data exports (e.g., ) and theme property access ().

The current phase of work has shifted to planning and initiating the development of the **Solution Admin Portal**. The AI engineer has proposed a detailed structure for this new portal, outlining 18 distinct screens across various administrative categories like Dashboard, User Management, Site Administration, System Configuration, Analytics & Reporting, Audit & Compliance, and Settings. The development approach for the Admin Portal is divided into three phases.

As of the last interaction, the engineer has started **Phase 1: Core Admin Functions** and has successfully created the first screen for this portal: . The next immediate step planned is to create the  screen within the same portal. The application is in a stable state with all Solution User screens fully operational and accessible, and the foundation for the Admin Portal is now being laid.
