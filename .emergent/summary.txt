The previous AI engineer successfully brought the construction management application from initial wireframes to a high-fidelity frontend. Initially, the focus was on resolving critical import and routing issues in React components (, ). After establishing a stable foundation, the engineer fully implemented the 18 screens of the Solution User Portal, integrating mock data and adhering to UX specifications. Subsequently, the development shifted to the Solution Admin Portal, where the engineer completed 10 screens, including a dashboard, user management, and AI model management, while also resolving numerous  icon import errors. A significant UX improvement involved applying a consistent Microsoft Office blue theme to the header and sidebar across both portals. Most recently, the engineer initiated and completed the implementation of interactive elements for the Dashboard and Live View screens within the Solution User Portal, systematically enhancing their functionality from static wireframes to more dynamic interfaces with modals, navigation, and controls. The trajectory shows a clear progression from foundational setup to comprehensive feature development and UX refinement.

The overarching goal is to develop a 360/Fisheye IP camera-driven construction management system. This system requires global map integration (Cesium), live RTSP streams, historical video feeds (Time Lapse, Comparison), local AI analysis (YOLOv8/v9, TensorRT) for PPE detection and tracking, a mobile Field Assessor with Street View navigation, comprehensive alert management, core management features (user, site, zone), automated camera patrols, and dynamic camera configuration. The architecture is a full-stack React frontend and FastAPI backend, segmented into VMS/NVR Core and Construction AI Management microservices, each with its own MySQL database. The UX design specifies 22 screens across four portals: Solution User, Solution Admin, VMS User, and VMS Admin, all adhering to a Microsoft Office blue theme. So far, the Solution User Portal (18 screens) has been fully implemented as high-fidelity wireframes with mock data and a consistent theme. The Solution Admin Portal has also been largely completed with 10 screens. Current efforts are focused on enhancing the interactivity of these existing high-fidelity screens.

**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   : Main React entry point for defining application routes.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include routes for all 18 Solution User Portal screens, , and all 10 Solution Admin Portal screens (AdminDashboard, UserDirectory, DepartmentManagement, AccessControl, SiteConfiguration, EquipmentManagement, AIModelManagement, SystemMonitoring, IntegrationSettings). Fixed duplicate imports.
-   : Manages the application's top navigation bar.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected import paths for  and . Modified to apply a Microsoft Office blue theme () to its background, with white text and icons, and translucent elements.
-   : Defines the primary navigation menu for both portals.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected import paths for  and . Added/organized navigation items for all Solution Admin Portal screens (User Directory, Department Management, Access Control, Site Configuration, Equipment Management, AI Model Management, System Monitoring, Integration Settings) under ORGANIZATION, AI MANAGEMENT, and SYSTEM CONFIG sections. Ensured scrollability and applied a darker blue theme () with white text and subtle highlights. Fixed a bug where sub-menus would collapse by updating the  state and using .
-   : Centralized mock data storage.
    -   **Changes**: Extended with , , , and  to support new screens and resolve export not found errors.
-   : Contains all Solution User Portal screens.
    -   **Changes**: Existing screens (, , , , ) were enhanced to include interactive elements such as modals, clickable cards, navigation links, and various controls (e.g., PTZ, recording, AI toggles). Multiple new files were created as high-fidelity wireframes (, , etc.).  and  had specific icon and theme property access fixes.
-   : Contains all Solution Admin Portal screens.
    -   **Changes**:  was created. , , , , , , , and  were subsequently created as high-fidelity wireframes. Various icon import errors (, , , ) were fixed in  and  by replacing non-existent icons with valid alternatives (, , ).

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing next level actions for the Solution User Portal, specifically focusing on enhancing interactivity beyond static wireframes. This involved a systematic, screen-by-screen approach, starting with the Dashboard and then moving to the Live View.

For the **Dashboard ()**, the engineer successfully implemented:
-   Functional View All buttons for Live Site Activity and Priority Alerts, which now trigger detailed activity and alert modals respectively.
-   Interactive Alert Cards and Activity Items that, when clicked, lead to specific alert details or open the activity modal.
-   Clickable Metric Cards that navigate to relevant detailed screens (e.g., Active Personnel to Personnel Tracking, Camera Status to Live View).
-   Modal interactions for both the Activity and Priority Alerts modals, including View Camera, Go to Live View, Investigate, Acknowledge, and close buttons.
-   Quick Action Buttons at the bottom for navigation.

Following the Dashboard, the engineer proceeded to the **Live View ()** screen, implementing comprehensive interactive functionality, including:
-   Grid Layout Controls (1x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4) that visually switch camera arrangements.
-   PTZ Camera Controls (directional, home, zoom in/out) with visual feedback.
-   Recording Controls (start/stop) with visual indicators per camera.
-   A Fullscreen Camera Modal that provides an immersive view with full PTZ controls, AI detection toggles, and recording controls.
-   A Camera Settings Modal for configuring resolution, frame rate, AI detection (person, PPE, equipment), confidence threshold, and recording quality.
-   AI Detection Interactivity, allowing clicks on detection boxes to open a detailed modal with PPE compliance warnings and a Create Alert button.
-   Enhanced Quick Actions like Start Street View, Alert Center (with badge count), and Export Evidence.

The current state is that the Dashboard and Live View screens now offer significant interactive functionality as high-fidelity mockups, and detailed testing instructions have been provided for both. The user's last explicit instruction was to move to second screen and then to continue with the next set of screens (1-9), implying a progression through the Solution User Portal.
