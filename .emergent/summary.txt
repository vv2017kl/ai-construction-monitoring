The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned an MVP into a more robust application, focusing heavily on enhancing the AI-CONSTRUCTION - Digital twin and backoffice development system. Initially, the work centered on debugging and refining the complex Cesium-based GeoSpatial View. This involved resolving critical compilation errors, improving UI/UX for an immersive 3D mapping experience, and ensuring accurate data visualization of construction sites, cameras, and alerts. The engineer systematically addressed issues like import errors, CSS conflicts, and data rendering discrepancies, ultimately delivering a fully functional geospatial dashboard. Upon completion of the Cesium enhancements, the user shifted focus to a comprehensive screen-by-screen analysis. This new phase, currently underway, aims to create detailed documentation for each of the application's 27 screens, outlining functional requirements, database schema, and specific integration needs for ZoneMinder (VMS) and Roboflow (AI models), all while establishing a centralized master database schema document for consistency.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to expand an existing AI-CONSTRUCTION - Digital Twin and Backoffice Development MVP into a feature-rich construction management system.

**Completed & Enhanced Areas:**
1.  **Existing Screens**: 8 out of 9 core screens (Dashboard, Live View, Alert Center, Site Overview, AI Analytics, Time Lapse, Reports Center, Admin Dashboard & User Directory) are functional, providing interactive metrics, live feeds, bulk operations, and comprehensive administration.
2.  **GeoSpatial View (Cesium-based Digital Twin)**: Fully implemented and enhanced. This 3D interactive map offers a global site overview with real satellite imagery, drill-down navigation (global, regional, site, camera), alert-based color-coded factory icons for sites, and IP camera icons for cameras. It provides an immersive, fullscreen user experience.

**Pending & Future Development:**
1.  **Database Migration**: Migrate from MongoDB to AWS MySQL. This requires a detailed screen-by-screen analysis to identify necessary tables, missing fields, and optimal schema.
2.  **ZoneMinder Integration**: Integrate with ZoneMinder for video management. This involves building a client API layer in the backend, querying ZoneMinder's MySQL database, and handling real-time video streams.
3.  **AI Integration**: Integrate Roboflow-deployed YOLO models for tasks like person and PPE detection. This necessitates defining input/output JSON structures and event flows for AI processing.
4.  **Comprehensive Screen Analysis**: Create a detailed analysis document for each of the 27 application screens (17 User Portal, 9 Admin Portal, 1 dynamic route) covering functional analysis, database requirements, ZoneMinder integration specifics, AI model usage, and backend API specifications. This process also involves creating and maintaining a  to centralize all application-specific database definitions.
5.  **Personnel Management Screen**: Has a known runtime bug needing a fix.
6.  **My Profile Screen**: Needs full implementation (initial import errors resolved, but core functionality is pending).

*   ****: Frontend build configuration. Significantly updated to include specific Webpack rules for CesiumJS. This involved configuring  to copy Cesium's static assets and defining  via , crucial for resolving Cesium bundle loading errors.
*   ****: Main entry point for React routing. Explored to verify screen routes, confirming  and other portal routes were defined.
*   ****: Defines the application's main navigation menu. Modified to rename Dashboard Home to My Dashboard and introduce a new GeoSpatial View menu item with its corresponding icon ().
*   ****: The overarching layout component. It was updated to accept a  prop, enabling dynamic control over sidebar visibility, which was essential for the immersive mode of the Cesium Dashboard.
*   ****: The primary component for the 3D geospatial view. Numerous changes were implemented:
    *   Fixed Lucide React icon imports (e.g.,  to ).
    *   Refactored to launch in a true fullscreen/immersive mode by default, completely bypassing the 's internal sidebar logic.
    *   Adjusted state management for view modes, site/camera selection, and alert panel visibility.
    *   Adapted to the new mock data structure for sites and cameras, ensuring correct filtering and display.
    *   Updated logic for handling camera zoom and site selection to improve focus.
*   ****: Renders the Cesium globe and its interactive elements.
    *   Integrated the Cesium Ion access token for high-quality satellite imagery.
    *   Implemented robust null checks and error handling for Cesium viewer initialization and event listeners to prevent runtime errors.
    *   Adjusted camera coordinate parsing ( instead of ).
    *   Updated  and  to display factory icons with alert-based color coding.  was also added for IP camera icons.
    *   Refined camera zoom levels () to ensure individual cameras are visible when zoomed to a specific site.
*   ****: The interactive control panel for the Cesium map.
    *   Updated to correctly group sites by  and filter by  based on the new mock data.
    *   Corrected the  property access to  for proper site dropdown population.
    *   Ensured consistent  usage with the new alert structure.
*   ****: Mock data for the Cesium map. Extensively updated to include more realistic construction sites (Dubai, Mumbai), 100+ cameras with detailed properties, and comprehensive alert data for testing visual features.
*   ****: User profile screen. Fixed a  by adding the missing  icon import from .
*   ****: A newly created document detailing the functional, database, ZoneMinder, and AI integration requirements for the My Dashboard screen. Initially listed gaps, then fully updated with complete solutions and now references .

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer commenced a major strategic initiative: a comprehensive, screen-by-screen analysis of the entire application. This detailed review aims to build a bulletproof backend development roadmap by meticulously documenting functional requirements, database schema needs, and specific integration points for ZoneMinder (VMS) and Roboflow (AI models) for each of the 27 identified application screens.

A significant architectural decision was made to introduce a  file. This new document will serve as the single source of truth for all application-specific database table definitions, which will be continuously updated as analysis progresses. This avoids redundant table definitions across multiple screen analysis documents and ensures consistency.

Current progress includes:
1.  **My Dashboard Screen Analysis ()**: The first analysis document, , has been successfully created and then extensively updated. It now provides a complete functional analysis, a detailed fixed database schema (with 8 tables, 3 new ones like , , , and optimized indexes), comprehensive ZoneMinder integration solutions (MySQL queries, API class, live stream management), Roboflow AI integration solutions (YOLO models for person and PPE detection with rich event structures), and full backend API specifications. This document correctly references the  for core table definitions.
2.  **GeoSpatial View Screen Analysis ()**: The engineer has initiated the analysis for the second screen in the user portal, the GeoSpatial View. This involves a deep dive into  and its related components to gather all necessary information for its dedicated analysis document. The goal is to detail its functional aspects, required database interactions, and how it will integrate with ZoneMinder for camera positioning and AI services for spatial analytics. The previous work involved meticulously debugging and enhancing this particular screen to be 100% functional with immersive features, making this analysis particularly important for translating its complex frontend functionality to backend requirements.
